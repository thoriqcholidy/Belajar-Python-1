# Belajar-Python-1

Hi !

I decided to learn Python for the first time because I was interested in exploring the capabilities of the language and how it could be used in various fields. In this tutorial, I focused on learning about data types, arithmetic, and temperature conversion. I found these topics to be essential foundations for building Python programs and was able to apply what I learned to create simple programs on my own. Overall, I'm thrilled with the progress I made during my first foray into Python and can't wait to continue learning and exploring the language further

I'm always looking for ways to improve, so if you have any advice or comments on my tutorial, I'd love to hear them.Thank you!
